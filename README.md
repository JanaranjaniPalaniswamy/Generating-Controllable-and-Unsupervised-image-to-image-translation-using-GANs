# Steps to run:

1. To run cycle gan full(forard and backward) with ls loss - Main_CycleGAN_LS_loss.ipynb
2. To run cycle gan forward with BCE loss - Main_ForwardCycleGAN_BCE.ipynb
3. To run cycle gan forward with Wloss - Main_ForwardCycleGAN_Wloss.ipynb
4. To run cycle gan full(forward and backward) with Wloss - Main_CycleGAN_Wloss.ipynb
5. To run cycle gan full(forward and backward) with Wloss, Weight decay, feature loss - Main_CycleGAN_FeatureCycleLoss_WeightDecay.ipynb

Our Model is used in Main_CycleGAN_FeatureCycleLoss_WeightDecay.ipynb
